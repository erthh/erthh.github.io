                                        Back when I was working at Wongnai in the Digital marketing team, my main responsibility was SEO, and my secondary responsibility was 
                                        Digital Marketing. My SEO work is divided into 3 main parts: 1. Improve SEO structure and solutions to increase the amount of organic 
                                        traffic on the company's website 2. Set up the structure and goal of content production with the content team intern of keywords, trends, 
                                        and traffic. 3.Report: Deliver weekly report for CEO, Marketing team, and content team
                                    </p>

                                    <p>
                                        To improve that SEO structure, essentially is to audit websites, see if any tags are missing, or what new from Google updateed algorithm has to implement 
                                        with the website. Working in this part will use a lot of programming skills because I have to read a lot of front-end code and have to read Google documents 
                                        continuously and work as a team with Dev team to tell them which part need to solve and then how to fix it in order to be correct with the SEO format at that time. Final product with dev team is, 
                                        we built our own CMS system with the Dev team for the Content team to use and manage all the articles. The CMS system behind that, 
                                        I develop with the Dev team in order to make the writing of the Content team the most SEO-based, without the need of writers to know SEO format. 
                                    </p>
                                    <span class="image main"><img src="images/mkt_101.png" alt="" /></span>
                                    <p>
                                        Working with the Content team was like a guide to lead the content teams into the right path of content production to increase organic 
                                        traffic then before. My main responsibility with content team was about Keyword Research. I find the Trend of keyword, find the term that 
                                        people are interested at that time, which is related to the core of our company (which is food), because the Content Team would not have time 
                                        to look in this keyword stuffs, I make a keyword report for them weekly that the content 
                                        team can divide the work correctly and create content that will impact the readers and traffic of the company at the same time.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        Report, I divided report into 2 parts. The first one is for Marketing team and CEO and the last one is for Content team. 
                                        The first report is about overall traffic, keyword, trend, and other stuffs that related to total traffic. For example, 
                                        How much has the website's traffic increased or decreased? and find reasons that why it increased or decreased, which total 
                                        traffic must be separated into parts such as Organic traffic, SEM traffic, Referal traffic, and others. The last part of the report is 
                                        for Content team is to make a report that will tell which keywords are interesting or trending at the time. What's the trend of the keywords 
                                        in this period? So the writer can see an overview of the readers' trends during that time
                                    </p>
                                    <h3>What I learned</h3>
									<ol>
										<li><b>Excel:</b> I use Excel every day from 1st day of working till present time. from the person who has zero excel knowledge now l can do everything such as various formulas, pivot, and scripting.</li>
										<li><b>SEO:</b> from zero SEO skill to expert. Now I knew all about website auditing, what meta tags are needed, which keyword research tools are used to find and apply to the Google keyword planner and to optimize the best keywords.</li>
										<li><b>Front-end development:</b> because the SEO of the website must be constantly revised. I have to sit and read the front-end code all the time and work with the Dev team to find bugs and improve them.</li>
                                        <li><b>Analytic tools:</b>Google Analytics, Youtube Analytics, and other social analytics tools </li>
