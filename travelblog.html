                                    <p>The idea of a travel blog was created by me and my two friends. We like to travel and photography. 
                                        So I thought why we didn't create a blog or facebook page, so it would be a record of our travel stories and can 
                                        share experiences here for the benefit of others as well. </p>
                                        <div style="display:flex"> 
                                            <span class="image left"><img src="images/neighbor/neighbor3.png" alt="" /></span>
                                        </div> </br> </br>
                                    <p>The work of this project is quite simple and fun because we liked to travel as our basis. Once our photos that 
                                        have been traveled and writings, share it on a facebook page, people gradually get to know more and more us. 
                                        I think why don’t we create a website as well because facebook content is easy come and easy go, It’s likes a 
                                        firework not long life span as content on website that people search on Google. If creating content and publishing 
                                        on the website and improve seo here, the content will be last forever and searchable on google because I have the skill of SEO also. </p>
                                        <div style="display:flex"> 
                                            <span class="image left"><img src="images/neighbor/neighbor2.png" alt="" /></span>
                                        </div> </br> </br>
                                    <p>Overall, this project is another project that is fun and has many good experiences. For example, we have been asked 
                                        for sponsered contents to travel in various places, have more people to know us, and to create a travel website, I also 
                                        put adsense in our website. This is another skill that has been learned to put ads into a website which is good we can 
                                        have some money back from people that read our contents, not just traveling and done. 
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
